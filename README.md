# IEEE-CS-Competition-2024-Serverless-Challenge
Authors: Ashraf Mahgoub (GM/Cruise), Jagannath Prabhakaran (Purdue University)

## Challenge Overview
This challenge focuses on predicting the invocation rates of Azure Serverless Functions using historical data. You are tasked with building a model capable of forecasting invocation rates.

Teams will be evaluated based on how well their models perform as well as a written analysis report. 

## Structure
- **Training Folder**: Contains training data (`day 01`) for model development.
- **Testing Folder**: Contains testing data (`day 08`) for evaluating the model.
- **Evaluation Script**: Jupyter notebook for evaluating model performance.

## How to Run
1. Train your model using data from the `Training` folder.
2. Evaluate your model using the data from the `Testing` folder and the provided evaluation script (`Evaluation_Script.ipynb`).
